Tech Stack:

Frontend: Flutter for building a beautiful and cross-platform mobile app (iOS & Android).
Backend: Go for developing a scalable and efficient backend API for data management and machine learning integration.
Machine Learning: Leverage various libraries and frameworks depending on specific functionalities (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn).

Scalability:

Horizontal Scaling: Utilize cloud platforms like GCP or AWS to scale the backend infrastructure horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased user load.
Microservices Architecture: Break down the backend into independent, loosely coupled services for better scalability and maintainability.
Database Selection: Choose a scalable and reliable database like Google Cloud Firestore or Amazon DynamoDB that can handle large datasets and high concurrent requests.
Data Privacy:

Data Encryption: Encrypt user data at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms.
Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to user data based on user roles and permissions.
Data Minimization: Collect only the data necessary for app functionality and avoid storing sensitive information unless strictly required.
User Consent: Obtain explicit user consent for data collection and usage, and provide clear information about data privacy practices.
Compliance: Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
