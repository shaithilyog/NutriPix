## Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have the following:

- **Flutter development environment:** Follow the official Flutter installation guide to set up Flutter on your system: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Git version control:** Download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **GitHub account:** Create a free GitHub account if you don't have one already: [https://github.com/login](https://github.com/login)
- **Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart:** Familiarity with Flutter development concepts and Dart programming language is helpful.

## Setting Up Development Environment

2. **Clone the Nutripix repository:** Open your terminal and navigate to your desired project directory. Use the following command to clone the Nutripix repository from GitHub:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/nutripix.git
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    
    content_copy
    
    Replace `username` with the actual username or organization that owns the Nutripix repository.
    
4. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command to enter the cloned directory:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd nutripix
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    
    content_copy
    
6. **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install the required Flutter packages for the project:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    flutter pub get
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    
    content_copy
    

## Understanding the Codebase

- Take some time to familiarize yourself with the Nutripix codebase structure. Explore the main directories like `lib/`, which contains the core Dart code, and `assets/`, which holds images and other resources.
- Consider reviewing the `pubspec.yaml` file to understand the project dependencies.

## Making a Change

2. **Identify an issue or feature:** Look for existing issues in the project's GitHub repository or consider adding a new feature you'd like to contribute.
    
4. **Create a new branch:** It's good practice to create a new branch for your specific changes. Use the following command to create a new branch named `your_branch_name`:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git checkout -b your_branch_name
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    
    content_copy
    
    Replace `your_branch_name` with a descriptive name for your changes (e.g., fix_login_bug or add_search_functionality).
    
6. **Make your changes:** Edit the relevant files in the project and implement your desired changes. Follow the coding style and conventions outlined in the next section.
    

## Creating a Pull Request

2. **Commit your changes:** Once you're satisfied with your changes, stage them using `git add` followed by a commit message using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`. The commit message should briefly describe the changes you made.
    
4. **Push your branch:** Push your local branch to your remote repository on GitHub using:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git push origin your_branch_name
    ```
    
    Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)
    
    content_copy
    
6. **Create a pull request:** Go to your forked Nutripix repository on GitHub. Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request." Select your branch with the changes and the main branch of the Nutripix repository (usually named "main" or "master"). Add a clear and concise title and description for your pull request explaining the changes you made.
    
8. **Review process:** The maintainers of the Nutripix repository will review your pull request. They may provide feedback or request additional changes. Address any feedback and iterate on your pull request until it's approved for merging.
    

## Coding Style and Conventions

- Maintain consistent indentation and spacing throughout your code.
- Follow standard Dart coding conventions as outlined in the official Dart style guide: [https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style)]
- Consider using a code formatter like Dart format to ensure consistent style: [https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format)]


## Testing Your Changes

- Utilize a testing framework like `test` package in Flutter: [https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/)
- Run the tests before submitting your pull request to ensure they pass and your changes don't break existing functionality.
